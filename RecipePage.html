   <h1>Mango Pickle</h1>
   <p>Mango pickle, or Aam ka Achar, is a quintessential Indian condiment made from raw green mangoes, oil, and spices. Below is a detailed recipe for a traditional, long-lasting North Indian (Punjabi) style mango pickle. </p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>Raw Green Mangoes: 1 kg (hard, firm skin)</li>
     <li>Mustard Oil: 1.5 cups (or enough to submerge, preferably cold-pressed)</li>
     <li>Salt: 1/2 cup (rock salt or sea salt is best for pickling)</li>
     <li>Turmeric Powder: 3 tablespoons</li>
     <li>Red Chilli Powder: 1/4 cup (use Kashmiri red chili for vibrant red color)</li>
     <li>Fenugreek Seeds (Methi): 1/4 cup</li>
     <li>Fennel Seeds (Saunf): 1/4 cup</li>
     <li>Nigella Seeds (Kalonji): 1 tablespoon</li>
     <li>Asafoetida (Hing): 1 teaspoon </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Instructions</h2>
   <ol>
     <li>Prep the Mangoes: Wash the mangoes thoroughly and pat them completely dry with a clean kitchen towel.</li>
     <li>Cut & Salt: Cut them into 1-inch cubes, leaving the hard seed shell inside to keep them crunchy. In a large bowl, mix the mango pieces with salt and turmeric powder.
</li>
     <li>Sun-Dry (Optional but Recommended): Spread the salted mangoes on a tray and place them in the hot sun for 1–2 days to remove excess moisture. If no sun, skip this step but ensure they are thoroughly dried with a towel.</li>

     <li>Mix Everything: In a large bowl, mix the dried mango pieces with the ground spices, nigella seeds, asafoetida, red chili powder, and the remaining salt.
</li>
     <li>Add Oil: Heat the mustard oil until it starts to smoke. Let it cool completely. Pour the cooled oil over the mango mixture and mix well.</li>
     <li>Store & Ferment: Transfer the mixture into a clean, sterilized glass or ceramic jar. Pour extra oil on top so it floats about 1-2 inches above the pickle.</li>
     <li>Sun-drying & Maturing: Cover the jar with a muslin cloth and leave it in the sun for 3–4 days, mixing it once daily with a dry spoon.</li>
     <li>Serve: The pickle is ready in 3-4 days, but tastes best after 10–12 days. </li>
   </ol>
